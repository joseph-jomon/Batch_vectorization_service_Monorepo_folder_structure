Concepts like monorepo folder structures for running services like Celery and FastAPI typically fall under the broader domain of **Software Architecture** and **DevOps**. Specifically, these concepts relate to:

### 1. **Software Architecture and Design Patterns:**
   - **Monorepo vs. Polyrepo**: The choice between a monorepo (a single repository for all codebases) and polyrepo (multiple repositories) is an architectural decision. Understanding the pros and cons of each approach and how to organize code, services, and dependencies is critical. This includes structuring services like FastAPI (for backend APIs) and Celery (for distributed task queues) in a cohesive manner.
   - **Microservices Architecture**: When dealing with multiple services, such as FastAPI for APIs and Celery for background tasks, you often explore microservices architecture, which influences how you structure your codebase and repositories.

### 2. **DevOps Practices:**
   - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Managing a monorepo often involves sophisticated continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to handle multiple services, version control, and deployment processes.
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, and Docker are often used alongside a monorepo to manage infrastructure, orchestrate services, and ensure consistency across environments.

### 3. **Best Practices in Software Development:**
   - **Modularization**: Breaking down your monorepo into modules or packages that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
   - **Dependency Management**: Handling dependencies in a monorepo setup, especially when dealing with different services that might have overlapping but differing dependencies.

### Where to Find Similar Knowledge:
- **Books and Courses** on Software Architecture, like *"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"* or *"Microservices Patterns"*.
- **DevOps and Infrastructure Management Resources**, including platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or Pluralsight.
- **Technical Blogs and Documentation**: Websites like Medium, Dev.to, and the official documentation of tools like Celery, FastAPI, Docker, and Kubernetes often have detailed articles and examples.
- **GitHub Repositories**: Explore open-source projects or boilerplates that demonstrate monorepo structures and best practices.
- **Communities and Forums**: Engage in discussions on platforms like Stack Overflow, Redditâ€™s r/devops, or specific communities related to FastAPI and Celery.

By exploring these areas, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to structure and manage a monorepo for services like Celery and FastAPI effectively.
