The response shows that the server is redirecting the request to a specific URL with a trailing slash: `http://aggregator.kundalin.com/aggregate/`. This can cause a 307 redirect if the URL in `self.aggregation_service_url` is specified without this trailing slash (`http://aggregator.kundalin.com/aggregate`), as the server sees them as different paths.

### Solution:
Ensure that the URL in `self.aggregation_service_url` matches the redirected location exactly, including the trailing slash. Update your code to:

```python
self.aggregation_service_url = "http://aggregator.kundalin.com/aggregate/"
```

Then retry the request:

```python
response = client.post(self.aggregation_service_url, json=payload)
```

If the trailing slash is included, the server should no longer attempt the redirect, and the request should go through as expected.
