Yes, with the current `docker-compose.yml` file, port 9200 for Elasticsearch is already mapped to the droplet’s host machine, as specified in this line:

```yaml
ports:
  - "9200:9200"
```

This means:
- **Elasticsearch is accessible on port 9200 on the droplet** (if the droplet firewall allows it).
- By opening port 9200 in the droplet’s firewall, you should be able to connect to Elasticsearch from external tools, like the NoSQL extension in VS Code, by using the droplet’s IP address.

### Steps to Enable Access:
1. **Open Port 9200 in the Firewall**:
   - If you’re using `ufw`, allow port 9200:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 9200/tcp
     ```
   - Alternatively, if using DigitalOcean’s cloud firewall, add a rule to allow incoming connections on port 9200 from your IP address only. This secures the setup.

2. **Connect with NoSQL Extension**:
   - In your VS Code NoSQL extension, connect using the droplet’s IP address and port:
     ```plaintext
     http://your_droplet_ip:9200
     ```
   This should let you view and manage Elasticsearch data directly from VS Code.

### **Important Security Note**:
Opening Elasticsearch to the public internet can be a security risk, as it may be targeted by bots. Consider limiting access to only your IP address or using SSH tunneling for more secure, indirect access. Let me know if you need more guidance on securing this setup!
