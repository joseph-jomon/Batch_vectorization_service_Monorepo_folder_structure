Yes, your understanding is correct.

In your setup:
- The **Dockerfile** sets **`WORKDIR /`** and copies **`./myapp`** to **`/myapp`** inside the container.
- The **CMD** runs Python with **`myapp.main:app`**, meaning Python starts executing from a context **outside of the `myapp`** folder.

Thus, **`myapp`** is treated as a top-level package. Therefore, imports within **`main.py`** should use:

```python
from myapp.tasks.text_batch_processor import process_text_batch
```

This is because Pythonâ€™s execution context is set such that it treats `myapp` as a module accessible from the root.
