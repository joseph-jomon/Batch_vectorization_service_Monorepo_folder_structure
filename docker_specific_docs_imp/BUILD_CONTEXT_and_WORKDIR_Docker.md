The `WORKDIR` and the build `context` in the Docker Compose file serve different purposes and operate at different stages of the Docker build and run process:

### **Build Context (in `docker-compose.yml`)**:
- **Purpose**: The `context` defines the directory on your host machine that Docker uses as the root for copying files during the image build process. It determines what files and directories are available to be copied into the Docker image when you run `docker-compose build`.
- **Example**: If `context: .` is set, Docker will consider all files and directories in the current directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) as the build context.

### **WORKDIR (in `Dockerfile`)**:
- **Purpose**: The `WORKDIR` sets the default working directory for the container at runtime. It specifies where the `CMD` and other commands (like `RUN`, `COPY`, etc.) are executed within the container.
- **Example**: If `WORKDIR /app` is set, any command in the Dockerfile (like `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`) or subsequent commands during container runtime will be executed inside the `/app` directory in the container.

### **Relationship**:
- **Build Context**: Determines what files are available to be copied into the container and where they come from on the host machine.
- **WORKDIR**: Specifies where in the container those files will be accessed and where commands will be executed after the image is built.

**In summary**: The `build context` controls the source files and directories available during the image build, while `WORKDIR` controls where in the container the commands are executed after the image is built.
