The error you're encountering is due to the system running out of space during the Docker build process: `OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device`. This is a common issue when dealing with large dependencies like `torch` and `torchvision`, which can take up significant disk space.

Here are a few strategies to resolve this:

### 1. **Free Up Disk Space**
   - **Check Docker Disk Usage**: Run `docker system df` to see how much disk space Docker is using.
   - **Clean Up Unused Docker Resources**: Run `docker system prune` to clean up unused containers, networks, images, and build cache. You can also use `docker system prune -a` to remove all unused images, not just dangling ones.
   - **Remove Unused Volumes**: Run `docker volume prune` to remove unused volumes.

### 2. **Use Smaller Base Images**
   If possible, consider switching to a lighter base image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`) in your Dockerfile. This can save considerable space.

### 3. **Install Packages Selectively**
   Try to install only the necessary packages in each service’s `requirements.txt`. Since some of the dependencies (like `torch` and `torchvision`) are quite large, evaluate whether they are needed for all services (e.g., `celery_worker` vs. `fastapi_service_batch_processing`).

### 4. **Increase Docker Storage Space**
   If you're working on a local system or cloud instance, you can try increasing the allocated storage for Docker by resizing your disk or adding more space to the relevant partition.

### 5. **Reduce Image Size**
   - Use the `--no-cache-dir` flag (which you are already using) to prevent pip from caching packages.
   - Use multi-stage builds in your Dockerfile to reduce the final image size. This can remove unnecessary build dependencies after the application is packaged.

### 6. **Optimize `torch` Installation**
   Since `torch` and related packages are quite large, you can attempt to install only the components you need, especially if you’re not using GPU support:
   - Install CPU-only versions of `torch` if you don’t need GPU support. You can specify this by using the appropriate URL for CPU versions during installation, or simply install `torch` without CUDA support.

### 7. **Mounting External Volumes**
   If your machine is low on space, consider using external or network-attached storage for Docker volumes. You can mount external volumes into Docker containers using the `--mount` or `-v` options.

Once you've addressed the space issue by cleaning up or resizing your storage, you should be able to rebuild the Docker containers without encountering the error.
