The issue you're describing—where the debugger successfully attaches to the FastAPI service but fails to hit breakpoints in the Celery worker, alongside the **port conflict** and **index error**—could be due to a few different problems. I'll address each aspect:

### 1. **Port Conflict for Debugpy**:
Your Docker Compose setup has both the FastAPI and Celery services trying to listen on the same debug port (`5678`). This setup leads to a **port conflict** since two different services cannot bind to the same port on the host machine at the same time.

### Solution:
To solve this, assign different ports to each service for debugging:

- **FastAPI Service**: Keep it on port `5678`.
- **Celery Worker**: Use a different port, such as `5679`.

Update your **`docker-compose-debug.yml`** as follows:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    container_name: redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

  fastapi_service_batch_processing:
    build:
      context: .  # Set the build context to the parent directory
      dockerfile: fastapi_service/Dockerfile  # Specify the Dockerfile location
    volumes:
      - ./myapp:/myapp  # Mount the myapp directory to /myapp in the container
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"  # Application port
      - "5678:5678"  # Debugger port for FastAPI service
    depends_on:
      - redis
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1  # Ensure Python output is flushed and displayed in real-time
    command: ["python", "-m", "debugpy", "--listen", "0.0.0.0:5678", "-m", "uvicorn", "myapp.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]

  celery_worker:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: celery_worker/Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./myapp:/myapp  # Mount the myapp directory to /myapp in the container
    ports:
      - "5679:5678"  # Debugger port for Celery worker (host:container)
    depends_on:
      - redis
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1  # Ensure Python output is flushed and displayed in real-time
    command: ["python", "-m", "debugpy", "--listen", "0.0.0.0:5678", "-m", "celery", "-A", "myapp.celery_app", "worker", "--loglevel=info"]
```

### Explanation:
- **FastAPI Service**: Still listens for the debugger on port `5678`.
- **Celery Worker**: The debugger listens on **port `5679`** on the host and **`5678`** in the container. This ensures no conflict occurs between the two services.

### 2. **Celery Worker Debugging Issue**:
The debugger may not hit the breakpoints in Celery tasks due to the **worker mode** and how Celery spawns child processes. Celery typically uses a process pool (multiprocessing), and debuggers like **debugpy** may struggle with stopping in those child processes.

To address this:
- Start the **Celery worker** with a **single worker process** to simplify debugging, as multiple processes can complicate breakpoints. You can achieve this by adding the `--concurrency=1` flag to the Celery worker command:

**Updated `docker-compose-debug.yml` for Celery Command**:
```yaml
celery_worker:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: celery_worker/Dockerfile
  volumes:
    - ./myapp:/myapp  # Mount the myapp directory to /myapp in the container
  ports:
    - "5679:5678"  # Debugger port for Celery worker (host:container)
  depends_on:
    - redis
  environment:
    - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1  # Ensure Python output is flushed and displayed in real-time
  command: ["python", "-m", "debugpy", "--listen", "0.0.0.0:5678", "-m", "celery", "-A", "myapp.celery_app", "worker", "--loglevel=info", "--concurrency=1"]
```

### 3. **Index Error Issue**:
The **IndexError** (`Dimension out of range`) is unrelated to the debugger, but it's crucial to address it since it's causing the task to fail:

**Error Details**:
```
IndexError: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 1)
```

**Explanation**:
- This error indicates that you're attempting to access a dimension in a tensor that does not exist.
- The line causing this error is:
  ```python
  return embeddings / embeddings.norm(dim=1, keepdim=True)
  ```
  - The problem could occur if `embeddings` is a 1D tensor (with only one dimension). If this is the case, accessing `dim=1` will fail because only `dim=0` is valid.
  
**Solution**:
- You need to ensure that the tensor has the expected number of dimensions before calling `.norm(dim=1)`. You can add a check or reshape the tensor appropriately if it’s a single-dimensional tensor.

Here is a possible solution:

```python
def normalize_embeddings(self, embeddings):
    if len(embeddings.shape) == 1:
        # If the embeddings are 1D, add an extra dimension
        embeddings = embeddings.unsqueeze(0)

    return embeddings / embeddings.norm(dim=1, keepdim=True)
```

### Summary:
1. **Port Conflict**:
   - Assign different ports (`5678` for FastAPI, `5679` for Celery) to avoid conflicts in `docker-compose-debug.yml`.

2. **Celery Debugger Issue**:
   - Add the `--concurrency=1` flag to run Celery with a single worker process, simplifying debugging.

3. **Index Error**:
   - Ensure that `embeddings` has at least two dimensions before trying to normalize it along `dim=1`. Add a check or reshape to prevent the `IndexError`.

These adjustments should help you successfully attach the debugger to both services, allow you to hit breakpoints in the Celery worker, and resolve the dimension-related error causing task failure.
